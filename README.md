# Manager API

The project is generated by [LoopBack](http://loopback.io).
It uses the Mongo DB database to manage the data layer

# warning
It's supposed to work on its own, but an angular app is built to 'display' (or use) this API: [Manager front-end](https://github.com/JulianH99/angular-loopback-frontend)
